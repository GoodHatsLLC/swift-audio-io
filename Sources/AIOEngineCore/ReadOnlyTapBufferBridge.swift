    /// Bridges the OS 27 `installAudioTap` provider's `AVReadOnlyAudioPCMBuffer`
    /// into the `AVAudioPCMBuffer` the capture path consumes, without copying
    /// samples.
    ///
    /// `AVReadOnlyAudioPCMBuffer` is a `Sendable` struct that owns its sample
    /// storage (its span-based `channelData` borrows from `self`), so holding a
    /// copy of the struct keeps the samples alive. The view built here exploits
    /// that: its deallocator captures the read-only buffer, tying the storage's
    /// lifetime to the view's own. That closes the one hazard a bare pointer
    /// wrap would have — `AVAudioConverter`'s C core is permitted to hold its
    /// previous input buffer until the next input-proc callback, and with the
    /// lifetime tie even a held view still points at live memory.
    ///
    /// The other half of the safety argument is `processAudio` itself: its
    /// input buffer is read only inside the synchronous `converter.convert`
    /// call and is never stored in state, rings, or an escaping closure, so
    /// nothing on our side outlives the callback either.
