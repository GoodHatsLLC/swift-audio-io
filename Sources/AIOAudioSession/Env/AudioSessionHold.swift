/// While at least one hold exists, the engine's release of session demand
/// after a stop is *deferred* rather than applied: the session stays active
/// until the last hold is released, and the deferred release then happens.
/// Release is explicit. A hold that is dropped without being released keeps
/// the session active, which is the honest failure mode for a surface that
/// forgot — the microphone indicator makes it visible.
